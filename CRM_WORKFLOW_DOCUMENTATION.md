## 1. LEAD CREATION PHASE

### 1.2 Lead Creation Process
```
POST /api/v1/leads
├── Validate lead data (email format, required fields)
├── Check for duplicate leads (by email + tenant)
├── Create Lead entity with initial data
├── Calculate Lead Score automatically
│   ├── Demographic Score (30%): Email quality, job title, completeness
│   ├── Firmographic Score (25%): Company analysis, job hierarchy
│   ├── Behavioral Score (25%): Status, notes, phone provision
│   └── Source Score (20%): Lead source quality weights
├── Assign Lead Score Grade (A: 80-100, B: 60-79, C: 40-59, D: 0-39)
├── Log lead creation activity
└── Return LeadResponse with calculated score
```

### 1.3 Lead Scoring Algorithm
- **A Grade (80-100)**: Hot leads - immediate follow-up required
- **B Grade (60-79)**: Warm leads - 24-hour follow-up
- **C Grade (40-59)**: Cold leads - nurture campaigns
- **D Grade (0-39)**: Poor leads - long-term nurturing

### 2.3 Lead Qualification Process
```

├── View detailed scoring components
├── Analyze lead quality factors
├── Make qualification decision
└── Update lead status accordingly
```

## 3. LEAD CONVERSION PHASE

### 3.1 Conversion Trigger
- Sales rep initiates conversion when lead is ready

├── Validate conversion request
├── Create Contact from Lead data

│   ├── Call Contacts Service API

├── Create Account (if requested)
│   ├── Check for existing account by name
│   ├── If exists: Use existing account ID
│   ├── If not exists: Create new account
│   ├── Handle duplicate account conflicts (409 errors)
│   └── Link contact to account
├── Create Deal/Opportunity
│   ├── Set initial deal stage
│   ├── Set deal value and probability
│   └── Link to contact and account
├── Update Lead status to CONVERTED
├── Log conversion activity
└── Return conversion response with IDs
```

### 3.3 Duplicate Account Handling
```
Account Creation Flow:
├── Search for existing account by name
├── If found: Return existing account ID
├── If not found: Attempt account creation
├── If 409 Conflict: Fallback search with multiple strategies
│   ├── /api/v1/accounts?search={name}
│   ├── /api/v1/accounts?accountName={name}
│   └── /api/v1/accounts (filter all)
└── If still not found: Continue without account
